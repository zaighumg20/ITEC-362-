                Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.</div>

            <div> Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</div>

        <div style="background-color:orange; position: absolute; left: 110px;top: 200px; width:200px; padding: 10px;"> Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</div>
